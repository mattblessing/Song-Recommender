# Song-Recommender
Developed two hybrid music recommender systems: one using conventional methods and the other using deep graph-based methods.

My presentation detailing the recommenders can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattblessing/Song-Recommender/refs/heads/main/presentation.pdf
).

See the demo below:

Note regarding use of 'The Spotify Million Playlist Dataset': according to [Spotify R&D](https://research.atspotify.com/2020/09/the-million-playlist-dataset-remastered/), the dataset will be "available on an ongoing, open-ended basis, and \[allowed\] for non-commercial, open research use."

Development was done in Python 3.9.
